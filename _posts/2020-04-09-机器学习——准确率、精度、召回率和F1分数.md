### Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithm ###

Once you have done a machine learning model for classification problem, we want to know the accuracy of prediction of the model. We can use accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score to show how good the model is.
### Basic Terms ###

Positive(P): The ground truth is positive (e.g. it is an iPhone)
Negative(N): The ground truth is negative (e.g. it is not an iPhone)
True Positive(TP): The prediction is positive; The ground truth is positive.
False Positive(FP): The prediction is positive; The ground truth is negative.
True Negative(TN): The prediction is negative; The ground truth is negative.
False Negative(FN): The prediction is negative; The ground truth is positive.

### Error ###

Proportion of all predictions that are incorrect. Error is a measurement of how bad a model is.

### Precision ###

Proportion of all positive predictions that are correct. Precision is a measurement of how many positive predictions were actual positive observations.

### Recall ###

Proportion of all real positive observations that are correct. Precision is a measure of how many actual positive observations were predicted correctly.

### F1-Score ###

The harmonic mean(调和平均数,又称倒数平均数) of precision and recall. F1 score is an ‘average’ of both precision and recall. We use the harmonic mean because it is the appropriate way to average ratios (while arthmetric mean is appropriate when it conceptually makes sense to add things up).
