### 导出波段的分辨率一致，SNAP Subset ###

1. 在Snap中加载需要导出的Sentinel 2 影像
2. Raster-> Subset,  设置Spatial Subset 和 Band Subset 确定导出的范围和波段，点击确定，左侧的列表框会出现裁剪和提取波段后的数据
3. 右键数据，选择 Open RGB Image Window，选择RGB合适的波段
4. 加载完毕后，右键图像，选择"Export View as Image",选择导出的区域(Image Region)、导出的分辨率(Image Resolution)和导出的数据格式,导出文件

it seems there are some issues with exporting S2 to GeoTiff. However, you can do the following.
Open the product and create a subset (Raster/Subset…) which contains only the required bands (B2,B3,B4) and the area you are interested in. Afterwards open the RGB image. Now right-click on the image and select “Export View as Image” from the context menu.



### 如果分辨率不一致，可能需要重采样 ###

t is basically a simple File > Export > 'GeoTiff / BigTiff' operation, however, it will throw an error as Sentinel-2 bands have various resolutions (10, 20, 60m).

Resample it first, then export.

Start Raster > Geometric Operations > Resampling. On the Resampling Parameters tab, you may choose any of B2, B3, B4 for the reference band, to resample all the bands to 10m resolution.
Create bands subset by Raster > Subset.
On the Product Explorer pane, click on the subset data to highlight then go to File > Export > 'GeoTiff / BigTiff'.
All bands such as the Band 1 (resolution: 60m) will be resampled to 10m in the first step. So this may not give you what you need, if the goal is to stack all the bands as-is.
